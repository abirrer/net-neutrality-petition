# Support Net Neutrality Petition

### Overview

<p>In 8 days, I create my first full website - a multi-page website to bring supporters of Net Neutrality together.  It is built without a framework, so just HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

### Website

<p>https://netneutralitypetition.herokuapp.com</p>

### Technologies Used

<p>HTML, CSS, Javascript, Canvas, Node,js, Express.js, Express Handlebars, jQuery, PostgreSQL</p>

### Key Features

<p>There is a registration page for new users or a log-in page for already registered users.  Here is the registration feature:</p>

</p>

<p>After a user signs up, they are directed to a page where they can enter profile details which can be edited later and used to show all users across the globe.</p>

</p>

<p>Then a user is directed to a page where they can sign the petition to support Net Neutrality. This feature is made possible by the HTML <canvas> element and mouse down/mouse move DOM manipulations.</p>

</p>

<p>The user can then see their saved signature, as well as click to view all supports around the globe or even all supporters in a particular location.  If a user uploaded a website in the Account Details page, then the website can is linked in each users name.</p>

</p>

<p>Users can view and edit their account details.  Once saved, the page reloads to show the most current account information.</p>

</p>

<p>Users can also choose to delete their signature and, if they want, resign the petition. Here we see Brad Pitt resign and the new signature is saved.</p>

</p>

<p>Lastly, I built a simple log out feature which then redirects the user to the log-in welcome page.  If a user logs back in, it takes them to their signature and options to view supporters page or account details page.</p>

</p>

### Future Features

<p>Would like to add a googlemaps feature to show all signers locations across the world.</p>
